# PaintDrawer
The most efficient way to waste your time in a coding project.
This Windows program literally opens Microsoft Paint and draws stuff on it by taking over control of your mouse.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any consequences of anyone having left this running on an unsupervised computer, writting weird messages on the screen every few minutes. Unless of course, that was me and I get caught. That hasn't happened yet. Nice.
